  This project is the first real virus prototype I made a few years ago. I used a series of bash scripts to run a python program in the background of the computer that would connect to a remote server to download the script to run.\
  I included a few features, such as the ability for the program to wait until a connection with the server was possible, and a backup of the last program executed in case the victim's connection was disabled.}
  The hosting service I used was pythonanywhere and the Django framework, but any server returning the proper file at the selected url should work.
