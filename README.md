\f0\fs24 \cf0 This project is the first real virus prototype I made a few years ago. I used a series of bash scripts to run a python program in the background of the computer that would connect to a remote server to download the script to run.\
I included a few features, such as the ability for the program to wait until a connection with the server was possible, and a backup of the last program executed in case the victim's connection was disabled.}
